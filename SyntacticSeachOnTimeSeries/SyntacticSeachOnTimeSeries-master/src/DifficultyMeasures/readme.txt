You can find some references about the Halstead Complexity on the following link:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halstead_complexity_measures

I adapted the code from the module "radon" which can be found in:

https://github.com/rubik/radon

Besides the Halstead complexity measures there are others already implemented.

To use the test code you have to first install the radon package:

sudo pip install radon

If python 3

sudo pip3 install radon
