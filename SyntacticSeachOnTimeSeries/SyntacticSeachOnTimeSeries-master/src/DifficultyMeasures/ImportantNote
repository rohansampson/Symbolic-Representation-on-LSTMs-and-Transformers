One important remark is that this module is not capable of measuring the difficulty of a regex.
Therefore one attempt has been made in which the Halstead measures are applyed to regex's.

The list of operators considered:
- '?'
- '+?', '*?'
- +, *
- (?=), (?<=), (?!<), (?!=)

If any other operator is used, please add it to the list.
